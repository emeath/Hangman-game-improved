# Hang man improved

This repo is a improvement of [this one](https://github.com/emeath/C_Harder-Better-Faster-Stronger/tree/main/hangman_game). This means that here good practices in C++ development are used such as 
- Separeted files (cpp and hpp)
- Not usage of global variables
- Use of an IDE (Codelite)

## Hang man game

This mini project uses the c++ 11 standard.

To make it easy to compile the code we are using MakeFile.

To compile using it, run:

```shell
make hangmanGame
```

To run it:

```shell
./hangmanGame
```
